## Problem Statement

Analyze the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset to identify content trends, geographic distribution, audience ratings, and growth patterns, and provide business recommendations through an interactive Business Intelligence dashboard.

## Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the Netflix dataset.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Identify key business KPIs.
- Visualize trends using an interactive dashboard.
- Generate business insights and recommendations.


  
## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a fully interactive **Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard** built on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. It was developed as part of the **IBM AICTE Internship Program** to demonstrate end-to-end BI skills including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI identification, trend analysis, and interactive visualization.

The dashboard provides strategic insights into Netflix's global content catalog — covering content type distribution, geographic reach, genre trends, audience ratings, seasonal patterns, and catalog growth over time.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Summary

### Data Quality
| Issue | Count | Action Taken |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Missing Director | 2,634 (29.9%) | Filled with "Unknown" |
| Missing Cast | 825 (9.4%) | Filled with "Unknown" |
| Missing Country | 831 (9.4%) | Filled with "Unknown" |
| Missing Date Added | 10 (0.1%) | Left as NaT |
| Missing Rating | 4 (0.0%) | Filled with "Not Rated" |
| Missing Duration | 3 (0.0%) | Left as NaN |

### Feature Engineering
- `year_added` / `month_added` — extracted from `date_added`
- `primary_country` — first country from multi-value `country` field
- `primary_genre` — first genre from multi-value `listed_in` field
- `decade` — release decade (e.g., 1990s, 2010s)
- `duration_value` — numeric duration extracted from string
- `age_at_add` — content age when added to Netflix

## 📈 Business Insights

### ✅ Trends
- Netflix catalog grew **5× from 2015 to 2019**
- Q4 (Oct–Dec) consistently shows the **highest monthly additions**
- TV Show proportion is increasing — reflecting shift to episodic content strategy

### 🌍 Geographic Drivers
- US, India, and UK account for **~62% of all content**
- South Korea and Japan are the **fastest growing non-English markets**
- Spanish-language content (Spain + Mexico + Colombia) shows strong growth

### 🎬 Content Drivers
- **International Movies** is the #1 genre (2,752 titles)
- Dramas and Comedies are universally dominant formats
- Most TV Shows have only **1 season** — limited series format is dominant

### ⚠️ Risks
- High US content dependency (42%) creates platform risk
- 30% missing director data hurts content attribution and recommendations
- Catalog concentration in English/Hindi languages

### 💡 Opportunities
- Korean, Japanese, and Spanish originals — high growth, high ROI segments
- Children & Family and Documentary genres are **underserved**
- Multi-season serialized shows can increase subscriber lock-in and retention

## 🤖 Prediction Model Note

A content-type classification model (Movie vs TV Show) can be built using features like:
- `primary_genre`, `primary_country`, `rating`, `release_year`
- Using **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest Classifier** (scikit-learn)

However, since the dataset is descriptive metadata (not behavioral engagement data), predictive modeling is supplementary to the BI objective of this project. The dashboard focuses on **descriptive and diagnostic analytics** as the primary deliverable.
